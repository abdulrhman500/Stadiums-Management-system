# Description

Designed a web-based application using ASP.NET and SQL for the databsee CSEN 501 Course. The aim of this project is to Provide a comprehensive and efficient system to supervise and organize sports leagues. We accomplished that by Integrating features to manage clubs, stadiums, and matches as well as tracking fan attendance. Each user is either a Sports Association Manager responsible for creating and deleting matches, Club Representative responsible for requesting to host the match on a stadium, Stadium Manager responsible for handling the requests to play on his stadium, Fan who purchases tickets or System admin who can create and delete clubs and stadiums.

##  Tools And Technologies

We used the following technologies:
- **ASP.NET** a Free, Cross-platform, Open source framework for building web apps and services with .NET and C#.
- **MSSQL** a relational database management system (RDBMS) that is designed to provide a high-reliability, high-performance, and easy-to-use solution for the development of SQL-based applications.
- **HTML, CSS** Markup languages for the layout of the page and frontend.
- **Git** a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## Milestones

The Project was completed over three main Milestones.

1) Designing an EERD and mapping it to a relational schema.
2) Creating the SQL Procedures and queries based on the schema.
3) Building the website including the front and back end.

## Run Locally

1) You will need SQL Server and Visual studio with its requirements.
2) Clone the project.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/abdulrhman500/Stadiums-Management-system.git
```
3) Open Databse/Database.sql and follow the instructions inside it and save the server name you connect to (If you use (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB you will not worry about the configuration).

4) Open the solution in Visual studio and run the login page.

5) Now you can navigate through the website freely.

P.S: You can use username: admin, password: admin to access as a System Admin.
